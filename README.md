## Quickstart

For run the project is necessary use a python enviroment. You might use the below code:

`pip install -r requeriments-dev.txt`

After, install the requeriments of projects

`pip install -r requeriments.txt`

Then, run the jupyter notebbok `train_test_notebook.ipynb` in there, you can train, the two ML avaible and can add others.
